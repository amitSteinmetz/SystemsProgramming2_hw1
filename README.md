What AdptArray should do:

1. Create an empty array
2. Delete the array - release the memory (free?)
3. Set - receive an element and index and put a *copy* of it in the right location in the array
4. Get - receive an index and return a *copy* of that element at this index
5. GetSize - return array size (-1 if array didnt create)
6. Print - print the elements in the array

* NOTE - Our exam in Systems Programming 1 last semester helped me to solve this assignment.
